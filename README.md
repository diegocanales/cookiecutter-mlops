# Cookiecutter MLOps

A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science projects with MLOps practices.

## [Project homepage](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template

- Python 3.6+
- [Cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft/): This can be installed with pip.

    ```bash
    pip install cruft
    ```

## Create a new project

```bash
cruft create https://github.com/diegocanales/cookiecutter-mlops.git
```

## The resulting directory structure

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:

```
TODO: create structure
```
